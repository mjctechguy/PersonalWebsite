During the UK lockdown, I've been watching a lot of YouTube video of people playing Classical and other genres (Pop, Memes, Video Game OST) music on the piano and violin. It's been a great time, but I've gained interest in learning to play the piano. 

I'll know it will be a long and complex journey,  I'm willing to put the effect in to make it happen. At least for now, I'm going teach myself it by using Alfred's Basic Adult Piano Course set of books starting at Level 1. 

I've already ordered a piano which is a Yamaha P-45 B,a fully-featured weighted 88 Key digital piano. I could've gotten a cheaper model but I wanted to get the full experience of playing a piano and have the ability to play an acoustic piano in the future.

I'll be documenting my progress learning the piano and have regular updates and videos, don't think I post alot of content just little videos of the music and piaces I play. Just a little bit of fun. Let's see how this goes.
